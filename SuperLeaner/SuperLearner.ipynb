    "The *Super Learner* is a heterogeneous stacked ensemble classifier. This is a classification model that uses a set of base classifiers of different types, the outputs of which are then combined in another classifier at the stacked layer. The Super Learner was described in [(van der Laan et al, 2007)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/19e9/c732082706f39d2ba12845851309714db135.pdf) but the stacked ensemble idea has been around for a long time. \n",

The base classifiers are trained and their outputs are combined along with the training dataset labels into a training set for the stack layer classifier. To avoid overfitting the generation of the stacked layer training set uses a k-fold cross validation process (described as V-fold in Figure 1). To further add variety to the base estimators a bootstrapping selection (as is used in the bagging ensemble approach).\n",

# Improve and Evaluate the performance of basic machine learning, deep learning and deep Q learning performance on Lunar lander.

### Introduction:
player_state.pkl - Machine Learning Model
player_images_2.mod,  - Deep Learning Model
dqn_LunarLander-v2_weights.h5f - Reinforcement Learning Model

These models are generated  from assignments.ipynb.
And then apply them to lunar lander to check their performance.

To test their performances, run 
lunar_lander_ml_images _player.py
lunar_lander_ml_states_player.py
lunar_lander_rl_player.py
